# Retirement Eligibility Checker
Checks if a user is eligible for retirements based on a specific criteria. 

## Requirements:
A company provides pension and other benefits to eligible retiring employees. The minimum age for retirement is 50 years. 
If a retiring employee’s age is at least 65 or their age plus years of service is at least 80 then that employee is eligible for a full pension. 
Otherwise, the retiring employee is eligible for a discounted (reduced) pension. 
Write a program that prompts the user for age and years of service, determines their eligibility, and prints the appropriate message as shown below.
